# Backend example

In this backend example for a project, a folder is created for each micoservice. 

1. Install docker to your system

## Modules

We use ES6 module system to import and export modules.

## Variables.env

We save credentials to other services in a `variables.env` file. This file is included in this template. However, it is common use not to include it in a public repository. There are some default key value pairs included to demonstrate its working.

- Microservice: sample microservice running on port:3011
